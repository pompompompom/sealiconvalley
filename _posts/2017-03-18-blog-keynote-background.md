Hello everyone, welcome to the first comic in the Sealicon Valley Tech Talk series: TIDE Talks!!

Have you ever wondered.. why do big companies choose to use dark background for their keynote / demos / announcements, especially if the event is held at an indoor auditorium? Dolphin the Engineer will talk about it from her personal experience!

Aside from the reasons mentioned by Dolphin - not getting an abstract artsy silhouette of the presenter - a dark background with gradient also helps make the product being presented stand out. Compared to a completely black background, a dark gradient background will make the product look more 3D, and help verify that the presentation tools are actually functioning. :)
